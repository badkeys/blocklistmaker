# blocklistmaker
Script to create blocklist of compromised private keys for the badkeys tool

# notes

If you merely want to use the [badkeys](https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys)
tool you don't need this. This is only supporting code to create the data
badkeys downloads with the *--update-bl*/*--update-bl-and-urls* parameters.

You need a subdirectory keyrepos with checkouts of the following git repositories:

```
 https://github.com/badkeys/debianopenssl
 https://github.com/badkeys/keypairvuln
 https://github.com/SecurityFail/kompromat
 https://github.com/SecurityFail/malware
```

*blocklistmaker* is a python script to create truncated hashes in suitable
formats for badkeys. *createlists* runs this script on all the key collections
and merges the result together.

# speed / performance

Some of the key repos contain very large directories, depending on the
filesystem accessing those can be very slow. The XFS filesystem is a good
choice for performance.

The script disables some RSA consistency checks in python cryptography
with the internal _rsa_skip_check_key symbol, this is only supported in
relatively recent versions. Also we monkeypatch the cryptography backend
to not enable RSA blinding, which also takes significant time.
